# BostonHousing

The inputs folder contains all the data used and some literature referenced in this paper. The raw data in this project can be accessed from http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston. It has the file name "raw_boston.txt". For this raw data to be used in this paper, the author has manually deleted the first 22 lines using Mac's "TextEdit" application, because those lines only contain explanatory notes but no actual data. The processed data has the file name "boston.txt".

The output folder contains the PDF version of the report, the reference file, cleaned data, and the code for the graph, data analysis, result and discussion part of this project
